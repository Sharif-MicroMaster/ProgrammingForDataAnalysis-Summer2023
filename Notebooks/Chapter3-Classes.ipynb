So what we can do is let the `mds_member` class handle our `first` and `last` argument and we'll just worry about `grade`. We can do this easily with the `super()` function. Things can get pretty complicated with `super()`, you can read more [here](https://realpython.com/python-super/#an-overview-of-pythons-super-function), but all you really need to know is that `super()` allows you to inherit attributes/methods from other classes."
